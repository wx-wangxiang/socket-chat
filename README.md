# Connecting clients

In this example a server is started and clients can connect at [http://127.0.0.0.1][1]. The server registers the connection and disconnection of users by logging to the console. The example deomonstrates how the server receives data from the clients via socket.io.

Install dependencies with 
    
    npm install

Start the server with

    node app.js

Then open your browser at [http://127.0.0.1:1337][1]. Watch the server logs to see that the server knows that a new client has connected. Open some more browser tabs at [http://127.0.0.1:1337][1]. You should see each new client being registered in the server logs. 

Next close some tabs. You should see this event is also registered in the logs.
